# Covid_Data_Visualization
Dataset: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv <br>
 The purpose of this code is to visualize and analyze the data of Covid-19. To do so, After cleaning the data with some techniques, I have used some packages of Python such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.<br>
 By using the plots, we can reach some general conclusions and realize the connection between different parameters.<br>
 Here you can see a plot that shows the total cases per million on 1st November 2020.<br>
