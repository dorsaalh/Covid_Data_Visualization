# Covid Data Visualization
Dataset: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv <br>
 The purpose of this code is to visualize and analyze the data of Covid-19. To do so, After cleaning the data with some techniques, I have used some packages of Python such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.<br>
 By using the plots, we can reach some general conclusions and realize the connection between different parameters.<br><br>
 The plot below results that  through 2020 to 2021, two countries have stronger peaks than two others.
